### *Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Fake Face*

Okay so here's the thing that keeps me up at night (aside from the usual existential dread and wondering if I turned off the stove): we live in an era where every single stupid thing you've ever done is just... *there*. Recorded. Archived. Ready to be dragged out and replayed at the worst possible moment, usually by someone with an anime profile picture and way too much time on their hands.

The idea of reinventing yourself—like, actually becoming a different person and having people *believe* it—is both desperately urgent and completely fucking impossible.[^1]

[^1]: This is the paradox that keeps therapists employed and Instagram influencers up at night deleting old tweets. The overlap between these two groups is more concerning than anyone wants to admit.

Which brings me to Glen Powell and his absolutely unhinged dual performance as Russ Holliday and Chad Powers—a show where the football team is literally called Catfish, because apparently someone looked at the concept of identity in the digital age and said "you know what this needs? Meta references, facial prosthetics, wigs, and elaborate lies about pee-holes."

And honestly? They were right.

### The Setup (Or: Everything Is Performance and We're All Just Bad Actors)

So here's what happens: Russ Holliday, star collegiate quarterback, is rushing toward a touchdown that will cement his legacy. Victory is literally inches away. And then he drops the ball. Before the end zone. The opposing team grabs it and wins the championship.

But wait, it gets worse.

In his distraught, rage-filled moment, he gets into an altercation with a fan on the sidelines and—I cannot stress this enough—tips the fan over *a boy in a wheelchair who has cancer*.[^2]

[^2]: This setup is deliberately, cartoonishly catastrophic—the kind of over-the-top premise that immediately establishes: this guy has nuked his life beyond repair.

Fast forward eight years. Russ Holliday is living what looks like freedom but feels like exile: driving a Cybertruck, babbling about cryptocurrency, hanging out with viral personalities who quickly realize they don't want to be associated with him, and somehow having competed on The Masked Singer.[^3] He's basically become a caricature of everything wrong with celebrity culture—entitled, performative, desperate for relevance, the kind of person who makes you cringe just by existing.

[^3]: The Masked Singer detail does a lot of heavy lifting here. Nothing says "I'm reinventing my public image" quite like competing on a show where the premise is literally hiding your identity. For Russ specifically, a man desperate to be someone else, choosing a show about elaborate disguises? The irony writes itself.

This isn't just a fumble. This isn't just bad optics. This is a *career nuke*, a reputation obliteration so complete that even when the XFL—an organization not known for being particularly squeamish—is ready to give him a chance, the boy in the wheelchair dies and the subsequent wave of anti-Russ sentiment spooks them into dropping him too.

These moments—the fumble, the wheelchair, the public disgrace—they just live there now. In the cloud. In collective memory. Replaying endlessly like that one embarrassing thing you said in 2012 that your brain helpfully reminds you about at 3 AM.[^4]

[^4]: The human brain is essentially a highlight reel of your worst moments, curated by a sadistic editor who believes personal growth comes from reliving your failures in excruciating detail. Evolution fucked up on this one.

So Russ does what any reasonable person with a makeup artist father would do: he uses facial prosthetics, a wig, and an entirely fabricated backstory to disguise himself as Chad Powers and try out for a small college football team in Georgia. A team called, and I cannot emphasize this enough, *Catfish*.[^5]

[^5]: The meta-commentary writes itself. Catfishing—the act of pretending to be someone you're not, usually online—is now the name of the team our catfishing protagonist is trying to join. It's like if a movie about bank robbers was sponsored by Wells Fargo. The audacity is almost offensively on-the-nose.

And thus Chad Powers is born: the eccentric, soft-spoken Southern walk-on who is somehow both a disguise and a whole-ass psychological refuge. Chad is everything Russ isn't—gentle, weird, morally competent despite being completely fucking bizarre. He's constructed from prosthetics and vague explanations, a mythic, outsider archetype that Powell inhabits with unsettling commitment.

(Stay with me, this is going somewhere. Probably.)

What makes this whole setup work is that these aren't just two characters—they're two caricatures, exaggerated to the point of absurdity, and through that exaggeration, Powell manages to say something actually profound about identity, performance, and how we're all just making this shit up as we go along.

### Part One: Stereotypes Are a Prison We Decorate Ourselves

Here's where it gets interesting (or where my overthinking finally pays off).

Russ Holliday is a walking, talking stereotype of the disgraced celebrity athlete. You know the type: arrogant, narcissistic, socially performative in that specific way that makes you cringe but also can't look away. His whole downfall is amplified by the permanence of digital memory—the fumble becomes a meme, the wheelchair incident becomes a cautionary tale, and suddenly you're the answer to a trivia question nobody wants to be.[^6]

[^6]: "Name an athlete who ruined their career in the most spectacular way possible." Congratulations, you're a verb now. "Don't Russ Holliday this opportunity" is probably something coaches say.

He's got the self-awareness of a brick and the self-pity of a deposed king. By exaggerating every flaw, every entitled expectation, every aggressive impulse, Powell reveals something uncomfortable: we have these assumptions about fame, masculinity, cultural sophistication, and most of them are bullshit we tell ourselves to make sense of a world that doesn't make sense.[^7]

[^7]: Society runs on shared delusions. Money is just paper we agree has value. Time is a construct. Celebrity is just people we've collectively decided to care about. Once you realize this, everything becomes both more absurd and more bearable. I don't make the rules. Actually, nobody does. That's the problem.</

### Now Flip to Chad Powers

Russ doesn't just inhabit the stereotype of the fallen athlete—he creates a counter-stereotype so absurdly extreme that you start questioning both versions. Chad Powers is the eccentric Southern walk-on who looks older than college age (explained vaguely as Covid-related, because nothing says "don't ask questions" like invoking the pandemic), has elaborate medical excuses (large pee-hole, can't shower with the team, infection risks), and a backstory so exaggerated it borders on Appalachian folklore—homeschooled in far West Virginia, raised off-grid, the kind of vague cultural eccentricity that makes people hesitate to probe further for fear of seeming classist or regionally prejudiced.

Is he genuinely eccentric, shaped by trauma, or simply not legible to their cultural expectations? The beauty is, people can't tell which, and social conventions prevent them from asking directly.[^8]

[^8]: This is why vague explanations work so well. Give people just enough information that they fill in the blanks themselves, usually with the most generous interpretation. Confronting someone about potential medical trauma or cultural difference feels uncomfortable, so people don't. Social conventions become camouflage—medical politeness and cultural sensitivity working in tandem.

Chad is the mythic Appalachian archetype—but cranked up until the dial breaks. The comedy isn't in the identity itself, but in how readily institutions accept a caricature rather than confront their own discomfort. Powell, being from Texas, is remixing a version of regional identity he knows intimately, exaggerating it into something that feels authentic enough to pass.[^9] It's an identity matryoshka doll: Glen Powell (Texan) playing Russ Holliday (disgraced athlete) playing Chad Powers (mythic West Virginian walk-on) on a team called Catfish (a term for online deception) in Georgia.

[^9]: This is the secret weapon of good disguise: take what you know, exaggerate it, and perform it with enough commitment that people accept it as truth. The performance works not because it's accurate, but because questioning it feels inappropriate.

The vague explanations are where Chad's strategy reveals itself. Covid explains why he looks older. A large pee-hole explains why he can't shower with the team (infection risks, very serious, don't ask follow-up questions). These aren't tight, rehearsed lies—they're deliberately loose, slightly uncomfortable, designed to make people back off rather than probe further.

What Powell is showing us through these dual caricatures is that identity isn't fixed—it's a negotiation. It's the space between what society expects you to be, what trauma has made you, and what you choose to perform. Sometimes the only way to navigate that space is to embrace the absurdity and let the stereotypes collapse under their own weight.

### Part Two: Trauma Is a Permanent Resident in Your Brain and It Doesn't Pay Rent

Beneath all the comedy and facial prosthetics, there's this deeply human story about trauma and guilt that Russ Holliday can't escape. The fumble. The wheelchair incident with a cancer kid. These aren't just plot points—they're scars that won't heal because the internet won't let them.[^10]

[^10]: The internet is basically a collective consciousness with perfect memory and zero compassion. It's like if God existed but was also extremely petty and had unlimited storage space.

This is, essentially, the Odysseus problem: the hero trying to return home after years in exile, using disguise and cunning to reclaim what was lost. Russ has been wandering for eight years, and like Odysseus, he adopts a disguise to infiltrate the world that rejected him. But here's the difference—Odysseus had gods on his side (well, some of them) and the natural decay of memory working in his favor. Russ has the internet—a force more unforgiving than any Olympian, with better record-keeping than the Fates themselves.

And Russ knows it. He even says at one point that God seems to find him just to put His fist up his bum.[^11] The universe isn't just indifferent to Russ's suffering—it's actively hostile, cosmically committed to reminding him of his worst moments at the most inconvenient times.

[^11]: This is different from the Greek concept of fate, where the gods at least had reasons for fucking with you—hubris, prophecy, you slept with the wrong person. Modern divine intervention is more random and petty. God's not teaching you a lesson; He's just bored and you're entertaining.

In the before-times (pre-2010), you could fuck up and it would fade. There was a natural decay to shame. Not anymore. Now every misstep is recorded, replayed, memed, weaponized. The fumble and the wheelchair incident became permanent markers, ready to surface at any attempt at reinvention.

The question hanging over the show (now renewed for a second season) is whether Russ will follow the Odysseus arc to its conclusion. Will he eventually reveal himself and face the consequences—or rewards? Or is this a darker, more modern retelling where the disguise becomes permanent, where there is no triumphant unmasking, only the exhausting maintenance of a false identity forever?[^12]

But here's the harder question, the one that makes this more than just a redemption story: Has Russ Holliday actually earned the right to step out from behind Chad Powers and reclaim his own name? Odysseus earned his homecoming through suffering and cunning, through twenty years of struggle. What has Russ done except hide? The disguise raises the oldest question in mythology: when the past is inescapable and you've become someone better by pretending to be someone else, do you even deserve to reclaim your original identity? And if you do—would you want to?

We don't know yet. And honestly, that's what makes it fascinating.

[^12]: My money's on some third option we haven't considered, because stories about identity in the digital age don't get to have clean endings. The internet doesn't do resolution; it does infinite loop.

This is the central tension: How can you reinvent yourself when the past is perpetually accessible and entirely unforgiving? How do you become someone new when everyone keeps replaying the old you on an infinite loop?

You can't. Not really. But you can try.

Chad Powers is that attempt—a psychological refuge created when the weight of public disgrace becomes unbearable. And here's where the absurdity becomes essential: Chad's vague explanations operate outside conventional scrutiny. Better not ask.[^13] The facial prosthetics and wig are physical markers, but the real disguise is psychological—strategically vague medical excuses and cultural eccentricities that prevent deeper questions.

[^13]: This is how many of us cope with trauma—we construct alternate versions of ourselves we can inhabit when the real one becomes too heavy. Some call it dissociation. Some call it survival. Some call it "having a work persona." The lines are blurrier than anyone admits.

By fully inhabiting Chad, Russ creates space to be competent, resilient, even heroic—without the baggage. Chad Powers is a survival mechanism, a vehicle for exploring who you might have been if that one moment hadn't defined you forever.

### Part Three: We Are All Performing for an Audience That Doesn't Exist (But Also Definitely Exists)

What's fascinating about Powell's dual-role performance is how it plays with audience perception. We, the viewers, know both personas come from the same person. We see the full spectrum—the performance, the absurdity, the psychological coping. But the characters within the story? They only see fragments.

Sound familiar? This is how we all experience reality now. Instagram stories, Twitter rants, LinkedIn humble-brags—fragments of performance we mistake for truth. We judge based on viral clips and curated feeds. The full picture is always obscured.[^14]

[^14]: We do this to ourselves too. We curate our own presentation, perform our own identity, then forget where the performance ends and the real self begins. Or maybe there is no real self. Maybe it's performances all the way down.

Chad Powers' vague explanations function on multiple levels: They're funny, they're character depth, and they're camouflage. Hide the real in the absurd, protect yourself with social discomfort. By weaponizing awkwardness, Powell lets audiences suspend disbelief while Chad's teammates accept contradictions because challenging them would be rude.

Together, these performances highlight something uncomfortable: we navigate scrutiny by crafting a coherent (but often deceptive) self-presentation. The difference between Russ/Chad and us is just the degree of exaggeration. They're cartoons. We're pencil sketches. But we're all drawings, not photographs.

### Part Four: The Digital Age Is a Prison Made of Our Own Content

Personal transformation used to happen somewhat privately. You could fuck up, move to a new town, start over. Your mistakes would fade with time, get reframed in small communities.

Now? Every failure is preserved indefinitely. Searchable. Shareable. Ready to be weaponized by strangers who've formed opinions based on a thirty-second clip from your worst day.

Russ Holliday's fumble and wheelchair incident are perfect examples of this nightmare. The past exists as a constant, inescapable record. Google doesn't forget. The internet doesn't forgive. And when your fuck-up involves tipping someone over a cancer kid in a wheelchair? The redemption arc isn't just steep—it's basically vertical.[^15]

[^15]: Cancel culture, redemption arcs, public apologies—these are all ways of grappling with the permanence of digital memory. We're trying to apply human concepts like forgiveness to a system with perfect recall and no capacity for nuance. It's like teaching empathy to a filing cabinet.

Chad Powers represents a creative solution. By adopting an entirely new persona—built from facial prosthetics, a wig, and strategically vague medical explanations that discourage follow-up questions—Russ navigates the impossible balance between self-preservation and public perception. He's not trying to rehabilitate Russ Holliday. He's trying to *become someone else entirely*, someone without that digital history.

But here's the crucial thing: reinvention isn't about *erasing* the past. It can't be, because the past is un-erasable now. Instead, it's about **reframing it through performance**, crafting a narrative that lets you retain dignity and agency despite prior transgressions.

The paradox remains sharp: even the most meticulous construction cannot fully escape history's weight. Identity becomes simultaneously fluid and fixed, performative and authentic, shaped as much by audience perception as self-conception. You can become someone new, but you never fully stop being who you were.

### Conclusion (Or: What the Fuck Do We Do With All This Information?)

Glen Powell's dual portrayal of Russ Holliday and Chad Powers is, on the surface, absurd comedy. Facial prosthetics. Pee-hole excuses. A disgraced athlete with unexamined trauma. But underneath is something genuine: a nuanced exploration of identity, guilt, and reinvention in an age where none of these things work the way they used to.

Through the contrast between the disgraced athlete and the eccentric Southern walk-on, the narrative reveals how identity is performative, malleable, continuously shaped by audience perception. But it also underscores the persistent weight of past actions. Mistakes are recorded. Replayed. Impossible to fully escape.

By exaggerating stereotypes and subverting expectations, Powell illuminates the tension between societal assumptions and personal reality. The absurdities of Chad Powers serve as both humor and psychological armor, a mechanism for negotiating shame, guilt, public scrutiny, and the impossibility of forgiveness.

In a world where every moment is preserved, survival isn't about erasing history. It's about crafting a narrative resilient enough to withstand its scrutiny. Sometimes that means inventing a whole new person with facial prosthetics and elaborate medical excuses, hoping people believe you enough to give you space to be something other than your worst moment.

But here's the uncomfortable truth the show eventually surfaces: "I'm Russ, but I'm also Chad." The performance becomes real. The fake persona develops genuine qualities. The identity you construct to escape yourself becomes part of who you are.[^16] This isn't redemption through transformation—it's the realization that all identity is performed, and performed identities can become as real as the "authentic" self we're trying to escape.

[^16]: This is the existential horror and liberation of performance: do it long enough, commit hard enough, and the mask becomes the face. Are you pretending to be kind, or have you become kind through pretending? The answer is both, and neither, and it doesn't matter because the effect is the same. Identity is what you do, not what you are.

The tale of Russ and Chad reminds us that identity is layered, performative, enduring—and exhausting. Maybe we're all just Chad Powers in different disguises, trying to survive in a world that records everything and forgives nothing. Maybe we're all on teams called Catfish, pretending to be someone slightly different than who we really are.

In a world that never forgets, the most honest thing you can do might not be to be yourself—but to choose which version of yourself you're willing to live as. And hope that version is good enough to let you sleep at night.

The universe watches this with a mixture of amusement and concern.[^17] We keep performing anyway.

[^17]: If the universe has consciousness, it's definitely tired. We're all tired. Being human in the digital age is like running a marathon where the finish line keeps moving and also everyone is filming you and the footage never gets deleted. No wonder we're all a little unhinged.

---

**P.S.** If you made it this far, congratulations. You've just read several thousand words about Glen Powell, identity crisis, and elaborate lies about pee-holes. I don't know what this says about either of us, but here we are.

**P.P.S.** The real question is whether Chad Powers' vague medical explanations are genius strategy or just what happens when you commit to a bit so hard that reality becomes optional.

**P.P.P.S.** I'm not saying we all need to invent alter egos with facial prosthetics to survive modern life, but I'm also not *not* saying that. The fact that the writers chose to name the team Catfish—on a show about catfishing—is either extremely on-the-nose or brilliantly self-aware. Probably both. Do with this information what you will.
