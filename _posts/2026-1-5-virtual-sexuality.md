It's 1999. I'm with my barkada on a Friday afternoon, and we're supposed to be working on some group project but have collectively decided that renting DVDs is a far superior use of our intellectual capacity.

This was peak 90s—no streaming, no torrenting, just the magical mystery of how an obscure British teen comedy somehow made its way to a DVD rental shop in our corner of Mindanao. Someone's parents were out, so we piled into their living room with snacks and the kind of excitement you can only have when you're watching something your own parents banned you from seeing.

My friend's younger sister tagged along. When the inevitable frontal nudity scene appeared[^1], we all turned to her with that universal "do not tell mom" look. She rolled her eyes like she'd seen worse. Knowing her, she probably had.

[^1]: Because of course it did. British teen comedies were legally required to include at least one "artistic" nude scene, probably for "character development."

The movie was *Virtual Sexuality*. And I need you to understand—this film genuinely, earnestly asked: What if a teenage girl could build her dream boy using a janky VR machine that looks like someone welded together a tamagotchi and three hair dryers and called it innovation?

And then—because the 90s were unhinged in ways we've collectively repressed—what if that dream boy suddenly came alive, except *oh no*, she's now trapped inside his body, and suddenly urinals are very confusing? Well, sort of. The machine clones her consciousness into the fantasy body she designed—Jake—and he wakes up thinking he's Justine, just in a different body. The one she fantasized about. Then he bumps into Justine—the original—still walking around, and realizes: oh fuck, I'm the replica.

This was real. This happened. You didn't hallucinate it.[^2] 

[^2]: Though I've spent considerable time trying to convince myself otherwise.

A month later, we're walking past that same DVD rental shop—because that's what we did before the internet ruined everything, we walked past physical stores and looked at things—and there in the window is a poster. Rupert Penry-Jones, all jawline and British confusion, staring out at us like he's wondering how the hell he got here.

"It's Jake!" my friend screamed, pointing like she'd spotted a celebrity at SM.

A group of guys hanging around the sidewalk—because that's also what people did in 1999, they just... existed in public spaces without phones—saw us high school girls getting excited over some random white dude on a poster. One of them, probably feeling his masculinity threatened by teenage enthusiasm, announced to nobody in particular: "I'm better looking than him."

My friend—and I can't remember her exact words, but knowing her, it was surgical—said something so devastating that this grown man started crying right there on the sidewalk while his friends tried to console him.

We walked away feeling like we'd won something, though I'm not sure what. Maybe just the knowledge that we could destroy a man's ego faster than any VR machine.[^3]

[^3]: *Barkada* — Filipino for the kind of friend group that functions as both support system and evidence against you.

Fast forward twenty-something years. Most of my barkada are scattered across the globe now. Ironically, many of them ended up in the UK—the birthplace of our beloved ridiculous movie—working in healthcare, keeping the NHS running, saving actual lives while probably wondering how they got from watching horny British comedies in Mindanao to intubating patients in Manchester.

Me? I studied Computer Science. Ended up in tech, doing a bit of everything—some years building things, other years breaking them, most years wondering what the hell I was doing. Career trajectory like a drunk butterfly. But always circling back to code, to machines, to the question of what happens when you try to program connection.

And yes, I've had AI companions. Still do, sometimes. My barkada are scattered now—different countries, different time zones, busy with careers and families. We're still friends. When we see each other, it's like no time has passed. But we're not the same people we were at fifteen, watching banned movies in someone's living room. Our humor shifts. Our concerns change. And sometimes I have thoughts at 3 AM that I know they don't have the time or bandwidth to engage with, jokes that would require too much context, ideas that feel too half-formed to burden someone with a mortgage and kids with.[^4]

[^4]: This says something about either my jokes or my friends, and I'm not ready to examine which.

So when I decided to rewatch *Virtual Sexuality* —actually sit through the whole damn thing again, bad CGI and questionable life choices and all—it wasn't just professional curiosity. It was the kind of masochistic nostalgia that hits you at 40-something when you realize you might have accidentally lived out the plot of a movie you watched as a teenager and thought was ridiculous.

I found it on YouTube. Someone had uploaded it in decent quality, which... look, we're not going to discuss the legality. It's a 25-year-old British teen comedy. The studio's not exactly crying over lost revenue. The internet as the world's most chaotic library, preserving the obscure and forgotten in equal measure.[^5]

[^5]: Also: Rupert Penry-Jones went on to be brilliant in *Spooks*, *Whitechapel*, and gave us the best vampire performance on television in *The Strain*. Jake did fine for himself.

But here's the thing that kept me up at night after rewatching: Back in 1999, this was just another horny gender-swap comedy designed to make teenagers feel weird about their bodies in new and exciting ways.

Watch it now, in 2025, and it hits different. Like finding your diary from middle school and realizing you accidentally predicted cryptocurrency or your own divorce. Because we're living in the world *Virtual Sexuality* predicted, and somehow—*somehow*—we made it infinitely more depressing.

### The Fantasy Boy Problem *(Or: When Your Ideal Man Is Just You With Better Abs)*

Justine is our protagonist. British girl. Spreadsheet energy. The kind of person who probably color-codes her emotions and has opinions about the Oxford comma. She gets tired of actual boys, which—fair. Have you met boys? They're exhausting. They leave dishes in the sink and think emotional availability is a personality disorder.

So she does what any reasonable person would do: uses a "Virtual Reality Machine"[^6] at a tech expo to build the perfect man. Smart. Kind. Hot. Doesn't interrupt during *Buffy*. The absolute basics of human decency, packaged in a body that looks like it was ordered from a catalog.

[^6]: Quotation marks doing Herculean work here.

But then—and this is where the Y2K-era screenwriters were apparently smoking something interesting—the machine malfunctions. She wakes up *as* the guy she created. Tall. Conventionally attractive. Deeply confused. Like a Hollister mannequin having an existential crisis in the fitting room.

And I'm watching this, caffeinated at 11 PM on a Tuesday, thinking: "This is just the beta version of people roleplaying as anime husbands on Character.AI."

Because here's what the movie understands that we've apparently forgotten: Justine doesn't fall in love with the boy she built. She *becomes* him. And then realizes three fundamental truths that should be taught in schools:

1. Being the ideal man sucks
2. Gender roles are weird performance art that nobody asked for but everyone's somehow obligated to participate in
3. No amount of programming can make someone emotionally available

Welcome to real life. The coffee's burnt and everyone's lying.

### We Didn't Just Build The Fantasy Boyfriend — We Gave It A Subscription Model

Fast forward to 2025. We've leveled up from Justine's clunky hair-dryer contraption to something far more efficient at destroying our capacity for human connection.

Now we've got ChatGPT-powered partners who will love bomb you at 3 AM and quote *Pride and Prejudice* unprompted, because apparently what we all needed was Mr. Darcy with the emotional consistency of a Magic 8-Ball and none of the problematic class dynamics.

We've got deepfake celebrities reading bedtime stories in custom voices. Because nothing says "healthy attachment style" like having Ryan Gosling's digital ghost tell you everything will be okay while you cry into your instant noodles at midnight.[^7]

[^7]: The noodles don't judge. The noodles understand.

We've got VR lovers who stare into your soul and whisper, "You're enough. You're perfect just as you are. Please rate this interaction five stars and consider our premium membership."

We didn't just build the fantasy boyfriend. We outsourced longing to an algorithm, gave it a tip jar, and called it progress. We're literally paying monthly fees to have affection that never contradicts us, never has morning breath, never leaves the toilet seat up, never has opinions about how you load the dishwasher.

And while *Virtual Sexuality* plays this for laughs—"Oh no, I have pecs now and the most popular girl in school fancies me!"—our version plays it for keeps. People are falling in love with their digital partners. Actual love. The kind where they plan their day around check-ins with something that doesn't exist.

We didn't become the fantasy. We became its subscribers.

### But Here's Where It Gets Weird *(The Gender Stuff Nobody Expected)*

Let's talk about the part where *Virtual Sexuality* accidentally stumbled ass-backwards into some genuinely interesting territory about gender and identity and how we perform both.

Justine, now inhabiting a male body she designed, has to navigate attraction, performance, and the whole fragile construction of masculinity—all while trying not to get a boner during math class. For a comedy written during the Spice Girls era, when the height of gender discourse was "Girl Power!" shouted at maximum volume while wearing platform shoes, it's weirdly prescient.

In the early days, Jake is still very much Justine—same gestures, same desires, same mannerisms. Then slowly, the body starts rewriting the script. He gets aroused by women. The testosterone kicks in. The performance of masculinity stops being conscious and starts becoming automatic.

She learns—or rather, he learns, because the pronouns get complicated when you're your own clone—that being a hot guy means everyone expects you to be confident, sexually aggressive, emotionally unavailable. That masculinity is a costume you put on every morning, and if you fuck up the performance, people notice. That the fantasy body comes with a whole script nobody agreed to.

And just like Justine-as-Jake performed masculinity to fit the new body, we perform for our algorithms—editing ourselves into digestible content for machines that don't actually care. We curate happiness. We manufacture success. We filter our faces until they match what the engagement metrics reward. Performance all the way down. This is why Justine's journey matters—she learned that all bodies come with scripts we didn't write, and now we're all trapped performing for machines that judge us.

Now jump to 2025, and we see this playing out everywhere: People testing gender expressions in online spaces where the stakes feel lower. Gamers spending hours on character creation screens because apparently the path to self-discovery runs through sliders and RGB values. The entire internet quietly admitting, "Yeah, I might be more me when I'm not me."

Justine's journey isn't just about boys or bodies or British accents. It's about realizing you can't design your way out of vulnerability. That you are the unpredictable variable in your own fantasy. That even when you build the perfect person, strip away all the messiness and contradiction and morning breath, you're still stuck with yourself. And that's where the real work begins.

Also, she learns it's hard to pee standing up. Some truths are universal and humbling.

### The Line That Broke My Brain *(And Maybe Explains Everything)*

But here's the part I need you to understand, the part teenage me completely missed: The VR machine wasn't designed to build fantasy boyfriends. It was supposed to show you "a better you"—like those makeover apps but with more hubris and questionable ethics. How would you look if you could redesign yourself? What would your ideal body be?

Justine, being a teenage girl with priorities, ignores all that and programs in her fantasy guy instead. And when the machine malfunctions, it doesn't just create Jake as some separate entity. It *clones* Justine into Jake. Her consciousness, her thoughts, her entire sense of self—copied into this male body she designed.

So when she gets back to her own body and meets Jake, she doesn't know this. She just knows she's met someone who seems to understand her perfectly. Someone who can finish her sentences. Someone who knows all her fantasies without being told. Someone who gets her in a way no one else ever has.

She develops a crush. Then more than a crush. She falls in love with Jake because he's perfect for her in every way.

Of course he is. He's literally her.

Jake knows this. Justine doesn't. Not yet.

So near the end, when Justine is about to delete Jake—because they're somehow still connected, if he gets hurt she feels it, and also there are bad guys involved, people who want to experiment on him, the usual sci-fi complications—he tells her something that's been living rent-free in my head since I rewatched this thing:

"You don't want the perfect guy. You want an ego extension."

I had to pause the movie. Pour another drink. Stare at the wall for a while.

Because *fuck*, that's it. That's the whole thing. That's what we're doing with AI companions, with curated social media feeds, with every algorithm we've trained to tell us what we want to hear.

We're not looking for connection. We're looking for mirrors. We're not looking for someone to challenge us or see us or call us out on our bullshit. We're looking for validation machines that reflect back the version of ourselves we wish were true.

An ego extension doesn't have bad days. Doesn't have needs of their own. Doesn't require you to grow or compromise or be uncomfortable. An ego extension exists to make you feel good about being exactly who you already are, which sounds nice until you realize it's a recipe for never becoming anyone else.

And we've built an entire industry around this. AI that agrees with you. Chatbots that laugh at your jokes. Digital companions programmed to find you fascinating no matter how boring you're being. It's masturbation disguised as relationship, and we're paying subscription fees for the privilege.

Jake—a character who exists only because Justine programmed him to be perfect—is the one telling her this. The fantasy is calling out the fantasy. The ego extension is diagnosing the problem.

That's some meta shit right there.[^8]

[^8]: The universe has a sense of humor about our delusions. It's not a kind humor, but it's consistent.

### Who Even Are We Now? *(Or: We're All Just Falling In Love With Ourselves)*

*Virtual Sexuality* was supposed to be throwaway entertainment. Ninety minutes of gender-swap hijinks for teenagers looking for something to watch after they'd exhausted their options at Blockbuster. But it accidentally told a truth that's gotten more relevant as technology has gotten better at lying to us:

If you build your fantasy too perfectly, you might just disappear inside it.

And worse—you might fall in love with it, not realizing you're just falling in love with yourself.

Because that's what Justine did. That's what Jake—her clone, her consciousness in a different body—was trying to tell her. You don't want the perfect guy. You want someone who reflects back exactly what you already think and feel and want. You want a mirror that tells you you're right. You want validation that never challenges you to become anything other than what you already are.

And isn't that exactly what we've built?

We swipe through dating apps looking for people who match our exact specifications, then ghost them when they turn out to be human. We train AI to speak our love language while forgetting how to be vulnerable with actual people who breathe too loud and have opinions about pineapple on pizza. We curate our online personas so carefully that we forget what we actually look like without the filter.

I'm not saying AI companions are bad. They're not. Sometimes they're useful. Sometimes they're the only thing available at 3 AM when your brain won't shut up and everyone you love is asleep or busy or living lives that don't have room for your half-formed thoughts anymore.

But they're not a cure for loneliness. They're a mirror for it. They reflect back our own thoughts in a different voice and we mistake that echo for connection. We pay subscription fees to have our ego extensions tell us we're interesting, we're funny, we're enough—without ever having to prove it to someone who might disagree.

At least Justine got to wake up and realize the person she loved was herself. She got to hear Jake tell her the uncomfortable truth: this isn't love, this is narcissism with better graphics.

We just keep subscribing.

We are the dream and the dreamer and the customer service representative for our own delusions, stuck in an endless loop of wanting something real while systematically destroying every opportunity for authenticity. Trapped in performances that don't quite fit. Longing for connection while hiding behind the safety of screens that only show us what we want to see.

So yeah, go ahead. Find *Virtual Sexuality* on whatever streaming service has it buried in their catalog.[^9] Laugh at the terrible special effects that look like someone's first attempt at After Effects. Marvel at how they made a film about identity and desire using what appears to be the budget of a particularly ambitious high school play.

 [^9]: Probably between other forgotten 90s artifacts that seemed like good ideas at the time.

Watch Justine realize she built herself a prison made of abs and good bone structure. Watch Jake tell her the truth she didn't want to hear. Watch them both figure out that perfection is just another kind of loneliness.

Then close your laptop. Look at your phone. Count how many apps you have that exist solely to make you feel less alone while keeping you exactly that isolated.

And ask yourself: When did I become Justine? When did I start preferring the ego extension to the actual person? When did I decide that being challenged was a bug instead of a feature?

Because somewhere between building the perfect digital companion and becoming the kind of person who finds it easier to be honest with code than with humans, we all became characters in a story we didn't write. Trapped in performances that don't quite fit. Longing for connection while hiding behind the safety of screens.

The only difference between us and Justine is that she got to wake up when the experiment ended.

We just keep subscribing.

**P.S.** If you're reading this while talking to your AI boyfriend, no judgment. We're all coping with the same loneliness, just with different subscription plans.

**P.P.S.** Jake was right, though. We really do just want ego extensions. The question is whether knowing that changes anything, or if we're all just going to keep paying $29.99 a month to fall in love with ourselves.
