Monday morning in this fucking city always feels like punishment for something you didn't do, or maybe for something you did but can't remember. The jeepney crawled through streets thick with exhaust and the particular brand of chaos that comes when ten million people try to get somewhere at the same time.[^1]

[^1]: There's a special poetry to traffic in this country that nobody asked for. It's like performance art, except everyone's a reluctant participant and the only audience is God, who stopped watching around 1986.

Humid air stuck to my skin, and I'm thinking this is just another day at the office, another day of processing forms and pretending to care about my family's little commercial real estate empire.

But then I walk up to our building and there's this small army of men with guns, serious faces, the kind of official presence that makes your stomach drop even when you know you haven't done anything wrong. Or maybe especially when you know you haven't done anything wrong, because in this country, innocence is often irrelevant.

"NBI," says this burly guy in a black shirt, like that explains everything. Maybe it does.

Inside, they spread mugshots across Valerie's desk—faces that have seen too much, done too much, except for this one woman in a red dress looking straight at the camera like she's posing for Tinder. Bright red lipstick, confident smile. The kind of woman who knows exactly what effect she has and uses it like a weapon.

"Recognize anyone?" the detective asks, and Christ, the thing about Filipino crime is how fucking polite everyone is about it. Even the cops ask nicely if you've seen the criminals.

Ray, our accountant who sits in the far corner but somehow always has the best view of everyone else's business, points to this young guy in the photos. "Him," he says with the certainty of someone who never missed a detail when it came to other people's drama.[^2] 

[^2]: Ray is the kind of guy who makes himself the main character in every office story, even crimes he wasn't involved in. His superpower is being simultaneously invisible and omniscient, like a judgmental office ghost.

One of our tenants points at Red Dress. "Her! She was around during the construction. Even borrowed a broom from my shop."

I stare at the same photo and feel nothing. Just this blank space where a memory should be. Only thing I remember is a baseball cap, which tells you everything about how forgettable this guy was designed to be.

The detective starts explaining their operation like he's giving a TED talk on creative entrepreneurship. These weren't your typical smash-and-grab idiots. These were artists, he says, professionals who treated robbery like a long-term business plan. They'd hit a city, disappear for years, let everyone forget, then come back with new methods, new faces, same precision.

"Two, three years ago, they hit another pawnshop here," the detective continues. "Broke into the bookstore next door, went up through the ceiling, then rappelled down into the pawnshop like some kind of heist movie. Different approach every time, but the same crew."[^3]

[^3]: The criminal justice system and I have very different definitions of "artist," but I'll admit there's something almost admirable about this level of commitment to craft. Almost.

"The woman," he points to Red Dress, "she's the closer. Charms the locals, makes friends, borrows fucking brooms if she has to. Classic misdirection."

And I'm sitting there staring at this empty chair eight feet from my desk, trying to reconstruct a face that was built to be forgotten, feeling like the biggest sucker in a city full of suckers.

### SEVEN DAYS EARLIER

Door opens, in walks Generic Filipino Male #1—the kind of face you see a thousand times on the MRT and never twice remember. Baseball cap, quiet voice, that careful politeness that could mean anything or nothing in this country where politeness is both armor and camouflage.

"I'd like to inquire about renting a unit," he says to Valerie, sitting down like he owns the place but doesn't want to make a big deal about it.

She pulls out the building plans, and I watch him study them with the focus of someone who actually gives a shit about floor layouts. Which should have been my first clue, because who the fuck cares that much about commercial real estate unless they're planning something?[^4] 

[^4]: In retrospect, this is where normal human suspicion should have kicked in. But hindsight is perfect vision and foresight is basically guesswork with anxiety, so here we are.

"Surplus TVs from Japan and Korea," he explains his business, and it sounds legitimate enough. Everything sounds legitimate in the Philippines if you say it with enough conviction and the right amount of boring detail.

I grab the keys while Valerie handles the sales pitch. Standard procedure, standard interaction, standard day. Except this guy, this perfectly forgettable guy, he's memorizing everything—the layout, the procedures, how we handle keys, where we keep what. Professional reconnaissance disguised as window shopping.

Our security guard takes him to see the units. Thirty minutes later, they're back.

"I'll take 204," he says, like he's ordering coffee. Simple. Clean. Done.

Unit 204. Right next to the pawnshop, sharing a wall. Of course.[^5]

[^5]: The universe has this habit of making everything obvious in hindsight while keeping you completely blind in the moment. It's like cosmic gaslighting, and I'm starting to think it does this for entertainment.

### TWO DAYS LATER

He's back with paperwork, still wearing that same fucking baseball cap like it's his trademark or his security blanket. Fills out forms while making small talk about commission deals on TV sales, the kind of meaningless chatter that builds rapport without saying anything real.

It's all so fucking normal it makes your teeth itch.

"When will I know about approval?" he asks, and there's this eagerness in his voice, like someone who really needs to get their business rolling. The urgency feels genuine enough.

After he leaves, Valerie mentions how polite he was. Professional. Efficient. All the qualities you want in a tenant, all the qualities that apparently make perfect cover for career criminals.

---

### THE NEXT DAY

The phone calls start. Valerie fielding them with growing irritation—Mr. Polite checking on his application, apologizing for being pushy, explaining his urgent business needs. Each call perfectly calibrated to show eagerness without raising suspicion.

"Persistent little shit," Valerie mutters after the third call.

My gut's starting to whisper warnings, but my brain's telling it to shut up. This is normal business anxiety, right? Everyone wants their applications approved fast. Everyone's got urgent deadlines and pressing needs and cash flow problems.

Except something about his urgency feels different. Focused. Like a countdown timer instead of impatience.[^6] 

[^6]: Your gut knows things your brain refuses to acknowledge because your brain is invested in everything being normal and fine and not requiring additional emotional labor. Your gut is Cassandra, and your brain is ancient Troy going "nah, that's probably just anxiety."

---

### SATURDAY MORNING

Approval comes through. Valerie calls him, he shows up within the hour with backup—this older, bald guy who sits in our waiting area and pretends to check his phone while obviously checking everything else. Management oversight, I now realize. Quality control.

Everything's going smooth until Julia, our cashier, gets nervous about weekend cash policies. She's always paranoid about money in the office, always worried about getting robbed.

"Someone might just rob our office," she says with that nervous laugh you make when you're trying to convince yourself you're being silly.

The irony would be funnier if it wasn't so fucking tragic.[^7]

[^7]: Irony is the universe's love language, and the universe is apparently very affectionate toward people who work in commercial real estate.

Baseball Cap produces a check without missing a beat, like he'd expected this, planned for this, probably had three different payment methods ready depending on what we required. That kind of preparation should have set off sirens, but we're just office workers processing routine transactions, not criminal profilers.

"We'll be doing construction inside," he mentions casually as he's leaving. "Let your guards know."

Construction. Right. Because that's what you call breaking through walls with professional demolition equipment.

---

### THAT NIGHT

While I'm home eating dinner and complaining about traffic, they're executing the heist of the fucking year. Precision demolition, chemical welding, the kind of professional operation that takes planning, skill, and balls the size of jeepney tires.

Red Dress is working the hallway, apologizing to neighbors for the construction noise, borrowing cleaning supplies, being the kind of helpful tenant everyone wishes they had. Classic Filipino hospitality as criminal misdirection—it's almost beautiful in its audacity.[^8]

[^8]: There's something deeply Filipino about weaponizing politeness and neighborly concern. We've turned niceness into an art form and occasionally into a felony.

They timed it perfectly. Weekend. Jewelry rotation. Minimal security. Maximum payoff. By Saturday midnight, they were done—bags loaded, equipment wiped clean and abandoned inside unit 204. Brand new power tools, chemicals, demolition gear, all of it left behind like disposable props. The cost of the equipment was just overhead, not worth the risk of being caught with it. The pawnshop would stay closed all Sunday, giving them a full day's head start before anyone discovered what happened. By the time Monday morning rolled around and the pawnshop staff saw that gaping hole in their wall, the crew was already scattered across the archipelago like seeds on the wind, leaving nothing but empty space where jewelry used to be and a check drawn on imaginary money.

---

### MONDAY MORNING - REALITY CHECK

The NBI wraps up their briefing with the weary efficiency of cops who've seen this movie before. These aren't amateurs, they explain. This is a career crew, professionals who understand that the best crimes are committed by people you never quite remember.

Julia does her own investigation. "Called the bank on his check," she reports. "Doesn't exist."

Of course it doesn't. Nothing about this was real except our gullibility.

That evening, riding home through the familiar chaos of traffic, I'm thinking about complicity and competence, about how easy it is to become an unwitting accomplice just by doing your job well. We weren't victims, exactly. We were tools. Useful idiots in expensive suits who processed their paperwork and asked no inconvenient questions.[^9]

[^9]: The difference between being a victim and being a tool is mostly about ego and self-perception. I prefer "victim" because it requires less self-reflection about my role in my own disasters.

"How was your day?" my mom asks over dinner.

I look down at my rice, thinking about truth and consequences, about the stories we tell ourselves to sleep at night.

"Nothing much," I say. "Just another Monday."

But it wasn't just another Monday, though at this point in my life, I'm starting to recognize a pattern. I have this weird talent for stumbling into situations I have no business being in—not as a participant, exactly, but as a witness. The person standing close enough to see everything but far enough to avoid consequences. The universe keeps putting me in the audience of other people's dramas, and I'm not sure if that's luck or cosmic comedy.[^10]

[^10]: Some people collect stamps. I apparently collect improbable stories about being tangentially involved in other people's criminal enterprises. It's not a great hobby, but at least it's memorable.

### YEARS LATER

Taxi driver's gossiping about another pawnshop heist—different method, same precision. Tunnels this time instead of walls. Evolution of technique, consistency of results.

"Police say they've been here before," he says with the excitement of someone who gets to share fresh scandal. "But this time they recruited miners—guys used to crawling through tight spaces, you know? Professional tunnel rats who could navigate sewers and bore through concrete floors like they were made of fucking cardboard."

The beauty of it, he explains with obvious admiration, is in the details. Early evening, the pawnshop's alarm goes off. Security does their sweep—everything looks normal because who the hell checks the floor during a routine alarm call? They're looking for broken windows, open doors, obvious signs of entry. Not examining the ground beneath their feet.

"The vibrations from all that drilling and boring," the driver continues, "that's what triggered the alarm. But by the time they discovered the hole the next morning, it was like something out of a movie—perfect circle cut right through the floor, clean as surgery."

I'm watching familiar streets scroll past, wondering if they're back, these artists of misdirection and theft. Wondering if somewhere in the city another office worker is processing another application, making another transaction, becoming another tool in another perfect crime.

Because that's the thing about living in a place like this—we're all potential accomplices in someone else's hustle. The only difference between victims and criminals is usually just timing and information. And sometimes, on particularly honest days, not even that.[^11] 

[^11]: Philosophers have spent centuries debating free will versus determinism. Meanwhile, Filipino criminals have perfected the art of making you an accomplice to your own robbery through nothing more elaborate than paperwork and politeness. That's efficiency.

The city keeps moving, keeps hustling, keeps generating the perfect cover for people who understand that the best place to hide is in plain sight, among people too busy surviving to ask uncomfortable questions.

In the end, we're all just trying to get through another Monday. Some of us just have more interesting ways of doing it.

**P.S.** True story, by the way. This happened almost twenty years ago when I was still naive enough to think that politeness always came from good intentions. Last year, a friend who owns a pawnshop told me how thieves checked into the hotel behind his shop, went through their room's window, across rooftops, and straight into his vault. Different method, same artistry. 

Apparently, some things about this country never change—including our talent for creative crime and our gift for being politely robbed.
