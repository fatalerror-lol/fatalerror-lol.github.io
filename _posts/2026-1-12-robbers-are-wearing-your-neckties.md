### *Or: A Love Letter to Philippine Optimism*

My mom told me this story when I was maybe eight or nine, the way you tell ghost stories except this one was real and happened to people she knew.[^1] Could have been our neighbors, could have been someone from another village—the details blur when you're a kid and every adult story feels like it's happening in some parallel universe where consequences actually matter and adults know what the fuck they're doing.

[^1]: The Philippines runs on these stories. Someone's cousin's friend's neighbor. Urban legends except they're not legends, they're just... Tuesdays. We collect them like other people collect stamps.

There was this family, see. Not swimming-in-money rich, but comfortable. Comfortable enough to have a business, comfortable enough to build walls. Twelve-foot concrete walls around their property, the kind where you can't see shit from the street except maybe the roof tiles and the tips of whatever trees they've got growing inside.

The kind of walls that whisper *we have things worth protecting* to anyone walking by.

Which, as it turns out, was exactly the problem.

Friday night. Because of course it was Friday. The universe has a sense of timing and it's mostly terrible. When the world's winding down and people are thinking about weekend plans, not armed robberies. When you're maybe deciding between pizza or adobo for dinner, debating whether to watch a movie or just scroll yourself into oblivion.

A group of men came knocking.

Not knocking, really. More like announcing themselves the way earthquakes announce themselves. The kind of entrance that says "we're not here for your hospitality."[^2]

[^2]: Though technically they stayed for the entire weekend, so maybe they WERE there for the hospitality. The universe appreciates irony.

They had a truck. They parked it inside the property like they owned the place, like they'd been planning this for weeks. Maybe they had been. Maybe they drove by every day for months, watching, waiting, counting the seconds until Friday night when the world looks the other way.

They held the family hostage and started loading that truck with everything that wasn't bolted down. TVs, jewelry, whatever cash they kept around the house, probably that one good Corelle dinnerware set every Filipino family has that only comes out for Christmas.

But here's the thing about criminals with trucks and time on their hands—they get greedy. They get comfortable. They start thinking bigger.

So they decided to stay the weekend.

Make themselves at home. Keep the family locked up until Monday morning when the banks opened, because why settle for the contents of someone's house when you can empty their entire fucking life savings?

Picture that weekend.

The patriarch sitting in his own living room, watching strangers eat his food, sleep in his beds, probably using his bathroom.[^3] Making themselves comfortable behind those twelve-foot walls that were supposed to keep the world out.

[^3]: There's something particularly violating about someone using your bathroom uninvited. Like they're not just stealing your stuff, they're stealing your intimacy, your private moments, your 3 AM sanctuary.

The same walls that now trapped his family inside with their captors.

Saturday morning. Saturday afternoon. Saturday night. Sunday morning. The hours stretching out like they do in nightmares, where time becomes this elastic thing that refuses to move forward. Your own house turning into a prison. Your own walls becoming your cage.

And here's the thing that gets me about this story, the thing that makes my brain do that uncomfortable clenching thing it does when reality turns out to be worse than any horror movie—the neighbors had no fucking clue.

People walking by on the street. Joggers doing their morning routine. Vendors selling whatever vendors sell. Whoever. They just saw walls. Normal walls doing what walls do. Concrete and silence. The family could have been getting tortured, could have been praying for their lives, could have been planning their own funeral arrangements, could have been having the absolute worst weekend of their existence, and the outside world would never know.

Because that's what twelve-foot walls do—they turn horror into just another Tuesday.

They turn your screaming into silence. Your terror into privacy. Your worst nightmare into nobody's business.

Monday morning comes.

The banks open. The patriarch gets escorted to make his withdrawals, probably with a gun pressed against his ribs and instructions about what happens to his family if he tries anything heroic.[^4] 

[^4]: Heroism is a luxury. It's what people with nothing to lose get to attempt. When you have a family, you have everything to lose, which means you have no choices at all.

He empties the accounts. Signs his name on the dotted line. Watches his life's work disappear into someone else's pockets. Every signature a little death. Every withdrawal a piece of his soul getting loaded into that truck along with the TVs and the jewelry and that one good dinnerware set.

Then they left.

Just like that. Took their truck, their money, their weekend memories of playing house behind someone else's walls, and disappeared back into whatever hole they crawled out of. Probably went home to their own families. Probably had their own walls. Probably slept just fine.

The universe doesn't care about your suffering. It's got other things to do. Planets to spin. Entropy to maintain. The general business of chaos.

Days later.

Because trauma needs time to settle before you can even think about doing something about it. Days later, the patriarch decides to report it. Uses his connections—because in this country, everything happens through connections, everything is someone's cousin's friend's boss's classmate, we're all six degrees from someone who knows someone—to get a meeting with some high-ranking military officer.

Or police, I can't remember which. Doesn't matter. Same difference in the end.[^5]

[^5]: The distinction between military and police in this country is mostly about uniforms and which building they report to. The rest is just variations on the same theme of power and where it actually goes.

He walks into the office, ready to tell his story, ready to demand justice or at least some performative concern, some acknowledgment that what happened to him matters, that the system gives a shit.

And there.

There, around the neck of this officer, this supposed protector of law and order, is one of his neckties.

One of the neckties that got loaded into that truck over the weekend.

And then—get this—the officer was immediately arrested. A full investigation was launched. All the robbers were tracked down and sent to prison. Every single item was recovered and returned. Justice was served. The family got therapy covered by the government. They lived happily ever after.

Wait, sorry. Wrong story. I was thinking of a Marvel movie for a second there.

None of that happened.

**Obviously none of that fucking happened.**[^6]

[^6]: This is the Philippines, not the MCU. We don't get satisfying third-act resolutions. We get neckties and shrugs and "what can you do?" We get Tuesday.

That's it. That's the whole story.

No shootout, no dramatic arrest, no justice served cold or hot or any temperature at all. No moment where the music swells and the good guys win and everything makes sense again. Just a man standing in a government office, looking at his own property wrapped around the throat of someone who was supposed to help him.

Just another Tuesday in paradise.

My mom told me this story matter-of-factly, the way you'd mention that it rained yesterday or that the store was out of milk or that you saw a cockroach the size of a small province in the bathroom. Just information. Just reality. Just the way things are.

No moral. No lesson. No "and this is why you should..." Because what's the lesson here? Don't build walls? Don't trust authority? Don't have nice things? Don't live in a country where the people who are supposed to protect you might literally be wearing your stolen neckties?

I don't know what happened to the family after. If they moved. If they rebuilt. If they ever trusted walls again. If they ever trusted anything again. These are just stories we tell each other, fragments of someone else's nightmare that somehow become part of our own understanding of how the world works, part of our collective DNA of "well, that's fucked up but also yeah, sounds about right."

But I remember that necktie detail.

Thirty-ish years later, give or take, and I still remember it.[^7]

[^7]: The brain is funny about what it keeps. You forget the name of your third-grade teacher but you remember a stranger's necktie wrapped around institutional betrayal. Priorities.

Because that's the thing about this country—it's not the crime that breaks you. Crime happens everywhere. Robberies, break-ins, violence—these are universal human hobbies, unfortunately. Every country has its share of people who've decided that other people's things should be their things.

It's the moment when you realize that the people who were supposed to protect you were in on it all along.

That's what breaks you.

The walls didn't betray them. The walls just did what walls do—they kept secrets. They maintained boundaries. They provided privacy that cut both ways.

The people, though.

The people with badges and authority and promises of justice and your fucking necktie around their throat.

They were the ones who betrayed everything.

Twelve-foot walls can't protect you from that.

They can keep out the world, sure. They can give you the illusion of safety, the feeling that you've done something, that you've taken precautions, that you're responsible and careful and smart.

But they can't protect you from the fact that sometimes the call is coming from inside the house. Sometimes the people who rob you are the same people who are supposed to catch the people who rob you. Sometimes the system isn't broken, it's working exactly as designed, just not for you.

Sometimes your walls just become a really nice venue for your own violation.

**P.S.** I think about this story every time someone talks about building higher walls, installing more security cameras, adding more locks. Like these things will save us. Like the problem is that we haven't fortified ourselves enough, haven't separated ourselves enough from each other, haven't built our walls high enough.

**P.P.S.** The walls aren't the problem. They never were. But we keep building them anyway because what else are we supposed to do? Trust people? That's hilarious.

**P.P.P.S.** Sometimes I wonder if the officer ever noticed. If he ever put on that necktie in the morning and thought about where it came from. If he ever felt anything. Or if that's just not how it works when you're on the winning side of twelve-foot walls.
